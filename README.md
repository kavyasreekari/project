# project
This project develops a real-time Face Mask Detection system that also predicts age and gender even with face masks. Using pre-trained CNN models like MobileNetV2, VGG16, and ResNet50, it classifies mask status and demographic traits with high accuracy. The system is optimized for real-time applications.
